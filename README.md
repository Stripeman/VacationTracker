# Trip Tracker

A dark, futuristic travel tracker built around a geographically accurate, rotating 3D globe. Plot every destination you've **visited**, have **planned**, or are still **dreaming** about — each pinned to the globe with colour‑coded markers, rich trip details, and flexible filtering.

## Features

### 🌍 Interactive globe
- Geographically accurate orthographic globe (D3 + world‑atlas TopoJSON) with land, country borders, graticule, and an atmospheric glow.
- Auto‑rotates when idle; **drag to spin** in any direction.
- Markers are colour‑coded by status. The selected location gets an **amber pulsing dot**, a label, and the globe flies to centre it.
- **Clustering** — destinations that share a location collapse into a single dot with a count badge. Click it to **fan the entries out** on connector lines and pick a specific trip.

### 📍 Destinations
- Add a destination with: **city**, optional **state**, **country**, **latitude/longitude**, **date(s)**, **status**, **visit type(s)**, **trip type(s)**, and free‑form **notes**.
- **Status**: Planned (blue) · Visited (green) · Dream destination (purple).
- Click any saved location (on the globe or in the list) to view its detail card, then **Edit** or **Delete** it.

### 🗓 Dates
- Pick a **single day** or **drag across the calendar** to select a date range.
- Choosing a date auto‑sets the status: a future date → **Planned**, today or past → **Visited** (you can still override).
- The calendar opens on the current month when adding a new destination.

### 📌 Smart location resolution
- Leave the coordinates blank and they're **fetched automatically** on save (geocoding), or use the **Auto‑locate** button in the form.
- If no coordinates are entered, the dot is placed from the **city → state → country**, in that order.
- **State is required** for U.S. cities.
- Adding a destination that matches an existing city **pre‑fills** its location info (everything except the dates).

### 🔎 Filtering
- **Free‑text search** — start typing to match destinations by **city, state, country, or notes**; results update live and respect every other active filter.
- Filter the destinations list by **year**, **status**, **visit type**, and **trip type** — all colour‑coded to match the globe.
- Per‑filter totals show the number of **trips** and **days**.
- The year list only contains years that actually have destinations. Defaults to the **current year**.
- Filters also **hide/show markers on the globe**.
- **Heat map** — a grid‑icon button beside the search box opens a right‑side panel that ranks countries by travel intensity (trips and days) over the filtered set, colour‑coded from cool to hot. Toggle the button to hide it and see the globe, and again to bring it back.

### 💾 Storage & backup
- Data is saved in your browser automatically.
- Optionally **link a JSON file** (Chromium browsers) so every change auto‑saves straight to disk — it reconnects to that file on your next visit.
- **Export / Import** with independent **Data** and **Settings** switches: back up or restore destinations, display settings, or both. Import only applies what you've switched on *and* what the file contains.
- **Clear data** always downloads a dated backup first.

### ⚙ Display settings
- Toggle whether the **Trip details** section is open by default on the form.
- Toggle whether **trip details** and the **status** appear on the detail card.

## Running it

Trip Tracker is a self‑contained design component. Two files must stay **side by side**:

```
Trip Tracker.dc.html   ← the app
support.js             ← the runtime it loads
README.md              ← this guide (also the in-app ? help)
demo-data.json         ← demo data, auto-loaded on a fresh visit (optional)
```

Because the app fetches map data and (optionally) links files, open it over **http**, not `file://`:

1. Open the project folder in your editor (e.g. VS Code).
2. Use a static server — the **Live Server** extension is the easiest: right‑click `Trip Tracker.dc.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

> **Note:** Linking a live JSON file uses the browser's File System Access API, available in Chromium‑based browsers (Chrome, Edge). Elsewhere, use **Export / Import** instead — that works everywhere. File pickers are also blocked inside sandboxed preview panes, so use a real browser tab for file linking.

### In‑app help

This very document is the app's help screen. The **?** button (top of the ⚙ settings panel, left of ⓘ) opens a guide rendered live from `README.md` — so there's only ever one file to maintain. Keep `README.md` next to the app and serve over http for it to load.

## Data format

On a **fresh visit** (when the browser has no saved data yet), the app fetches **`demo-data.json`** from its own folder and loads it as the starting dataset — handy for demos and for shipping a curated set to whoever opens the app. Once data exists in the browser, that local copy is used and the file is no longer read (so a viewer's edits stick). Replace `demo-data.json` to change the demo set.

Exporting **everything** produces a file named **`trip-tracker.json`** — deliberately different from `demo-data.json` so dropping an export into the app folder never silently overwrites the bundled demo. The file uses the same shape:

```json
{
  "app": "vacation-location",
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAt": "2026-06-19T00:00:00.000Z",
  "settings": { "detailsFormDefault": true, "detailsCard": true, "statusCard": true },
  "locations": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "city": "Paris",
      "state": "",
      "country": "France",
      "lat": "48.8566",
      "lon": "2.3522",
      "date": "2024-06-14",
      "dateEnd": "2024-06-21",
      "status": "visited",
      "notes": "Summer evenings in Le Marais",
      "visitTypes": ["city"],
      "tripTypes": ["vacation"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Data‑only and settings‑only exports contain just the `locations` or `settings` key respectively. Imports accept any of these shapes (a bare array of locations is also supported for backward compatibility).
